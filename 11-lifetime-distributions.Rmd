### **Chapter 6: Survival Models â€“ Lifetime Distributions**

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of modelling human lifetimes or failure times as random variables, forming the bedrock of actuarial work related to mortality and other decrements.

#### **1. Introduction to Survival Models**
At its core, a survival model treats the future lifetime of an individual (or the "failure time" of an item) as a continuous random variable. While typically applied to human mortality, the theory extends broadly to other contexts, such as:
*   Analysing the duration of insurance policies (where "mortality" is replaced by "withdrawal").
*   Modelling the time individuals remain in a healthy state (where "mortality" is replaced by "sickness").
*   Studying mechanical breakdown times.

#### **2. Model of Lifetime or Failure Time**
The central concept is that the future lifetime of a person or entity is inherently uncertain.
*   **Future Lifetime Random Variable ($T$)**: The notation $T$ often represents the future lifetime of a new-born.
*   **Future Lifetime After Age $x$ ($T_x$)**: To account for lives at ages greater than zero, $T_x$ is defined as the random future lifetime of a life who survives to exact age $x$. $T_x$ is assumed to be a continuous random variable taking values in $[0, \omega - x]$, where $\omega$ is the limiting age. Notably, $T_0 = T$.

#### **3. Key Functions and Relationships**
For a life aged $x$, several interrelated functions define its future lifetime distribution:

*   **Distribution Function ($F_x(t)$)**:
    *   Defined as $F_x(t) = P[T_x \le t]$.
    *   Represents the probability that a life aged $x$ dies within the next $t$ years.
    *   Actuarial symbol: $q_x(t) = F_x(t)$.

*   **Survival Function ($S_x(t)$)**:
    *   Defined as $S_x(t) = P[T_x > t]$.
    *   Represents the probability that a life aged $x$ survives for at least $t$ years.
    *   Relationship with distribution function: $S_x(t) = 1 - F_x(t)$.
    *   Actuarial symbol: $p_x(t) = S_x(t)$.
    *   **Consistency Condition**: For any $s, t \ge 0$ and $x \ge 0$, the survival functions satisfy $p_x(s+t) = p_x(s) \cdot p_{x+s}(t)$. This implies that the probability of surviving for $s+t$ years from age $x$ is the probability of surviving $s$ years from $x$ multiplied by the probability of surviving an additional $t$ years from age $x+s$.

*   **Probability Density Function ($f_x(t)$)**:
    *   Defined as $f_x(t) = \frac{d}{dt} F_x(t)$.
    *   Represents the instantaneous rate of death at exact age $x+t$, given survival to $x+t$.
    *   Relationship: $f_x(t) = p_x(t) \cdot \mu_{x+t}$ for $0 \le t < \omega - x$.

*   **Force of Mortality (Hazard Rate) ($\mu_{x+t}$ or $h(t)$)**:
    *   The instantaneous rate of mortality at exact age $x+t$. In statistics, it is widely known as the hazard rate.
    *   Definition: $\mu_{x+t} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{P[T_x \le t+h | T_x > t]}{h}$.
    *   Relationship with $f_x(t)$ and $S_x(t)$: $\mu_{x+t} = \frac{f_x(t)}{S_x(t)}$. It can also be expressed as $\mu_{x+t} = -\frac{S_x'(t)}{S_x(t)}$.
    *   Approximate relationship for small $h$: $h \mu_x \approx h q_x$.
    *   **Integral Formulae for $p_x(t)$ and $q_x(t)$**:
        *   $p_x(t) = \exp \left( -\int_0^t \mu_{x+s} ds \right)$. This is a very important result, also found on page 32 of the Tables.
        *   $q_x(t) = \int_0^t p_x(s) \mu_{x+s} ds$.

#### **4. Life Table Functions**
Life tables are computational tools that summarise mortality experience, typically used to calculate probabilities of mortality and survival for a hypothetical group of lives.
*   **$l_x$**: The expected number of lives surviving to exact age $x$ from a starting group (e.g., 100,000 at age 0).
*   **$d_x$**: The expected number of deaths between exact age $x$ and $x+1$. $d_x = l_x - l_{x+1}$.
*   **$q_x$ (Initial Rate of Mortality)**: The probability that a life aged exactly $x$ dies before reaching exact age $x+1$. $q_x = d_x / l_x$.
*   **$p_x$**: The probability that a life aged exactly $x$ survives to exact age $x+1$. $p_x = l_{x+1} / l_x = 1 - q_x$.
*   **$m_x$ (Central Rate of Mortality)**: The probability of dying between exact ages $x$ and $x+1$ per person-year lived between these ages. It is defined as $m_x = \frac{q_x}{\int_0^1 p_x(t) dt}$. $m_x$ can be expressed as a weighted average of the force of mortality $\mu_{x+t}$ over the year of age $x$ to $x+1$, with weights being the survival probabilities $p_x(t)$.

#### **5. Curtate Future Lifetime ($K_x$)**
*   **Definition**: The curtate future lifetime $K_x$ of a life aged exactly $x$ is the whole number of *complete* years lived after age $x$. It is the integer part of $T_x$, denoted as $K_x = \lfloor T_x \rfloor$.
*   **Nature**: $K_x$ is a discrete random variable, taking integer values $0, 1, 2, \dots, \omega - x - 1$.
*   **Probability Function**: $P[K_x = k] = p_x(k) - p_x(k+1) = {}_{k|}q_x = p_x(k) \cdot q_{x+k}$.

#### **6. Expectations of Life**
These measures quantify the average future time an individual is expected to live.

*   **Complete Expectation of Life ($\mathring{e}_x$)**:
    *   **Definition**: The expected value of the complete future lifetime $T_x$.
    *   **Formula**: $\mathring{e}_x = E[T_x] = \int_0^\infty p_x(t) dt$. This integral formula is derived by integrating by parts from the definition $E[T_x] = \int_0^\infty t f_x(t) dt$.

*   **Curtate Expectation of Life ($e_x$)**:
    *   **Definition**: The expected value of the curtate future lifetime $K_x$.
    *   **Formula**: $e_x = E[K_x] = \sum_{k=1}^\infty p_x(k)$. This can also be written as $e_x = p_x(1+e_{x+1})$.

*   **Approximate Relation Between $\mathring{e}_x$ and $e_x$**:
    *   $\mathring{e}_x \approx e_x + 0.5$.
    *   This approximation assumes that, on average, deaths occur halfway between birthdays, meaning $E[T_x - K_x] \approx 0.5$. The approximation becomes exact if deaths occur uniformly between birthdays.

#### **7. Variance of Future Lifetimes**
*   **Variance of Complete Future Lifetime ($\text{var}[T_x]$)**:
    *   $\text{var}[T_x] = \int_0^\infty t^2 p_x(t) \mu_{x+t} dt - (\mathring{e}_x)^2$.
*   **Variance of Curtate Future Lifetime ($\text{var}[K_x]$)**:
    *   $\text{var}[K_x] = \sum_{k=0}^{\omega-x-1} k^2 P[K_x=k] - (e_x)^2$.

#### **8. Simple Parametric Survival Models**
These models define the future lifetime distribution using a small number of parameters, making them suitable for fitting to data.

*   **Exponential Model**:
    *   Assumes a **constant force of mortality**: $\mu_x = \mu$ for all $x$.
    *   Survival function: $p_x(t) = e^{-\mu t}$. This makes the future lifetime $T_x$ follow an exponential distribution with parameter $\mu$.
    *   Often used for modelling risks like "death from unnatural causes, e.g., accident or murder" where the risk doesn't depend on age.
    *   **R Implementation**: `dexp()`, `pexp()`, `qexp()`, `rexp()` functions are available.

*   **Weibull Model**:
    *   Characterised by a hazard rate (force of mortality) that can be **monotonically increasing or decreasing** depending on its parameters.
    *   Survival function: $S_x(t) = \exp(-\alpha t^\beta)$ (where $\alpha, \beta$ are parameters).
    *   Force of mortality: $\mu_{x+t} = \alpha\beta t^{\beta-1}$.
    *   If $\beta=1$, it reduces to the exponential model. If $\beta < 1$, the hazard is decreasing, suitable for risks like recovering from major surgery; if $\beta > 1$, the hazard is increasing, like for items that wear out over time.
    *   **R Implementation**: `dweibull()`, `pweibull()`, `qweibull()`, `rweibull()` are used, but note R's parameterization might differ (using shape and scale parameters).

*   **Gompertz Law of Mortality**:
    *   Assumes an **exponentially increasing force of mortality** with age: $\mu_x = B c^x$.
    *   This law is reasonable for modelling mortality in middle and older ages.
    *   Parameters $B$ and $c$ can be determined from mortality rates at two different ages.
    *   Survival probabilities can be found using specific integral formulae.
    *   **R Implementation**: The `flexsurv` package provides `dgompertz()`, `pgompertz()`, `qgompertz()`, `rgompertz()`.

*   **Makeham's Law of Mortality**:
    *   An extension of Gompertz' Law, adding a constant term: $\mu_x = A + B c^x$.
    *   The constant term $A$ is often interpreted as an allowance for **accidental deaths** which do not depend on age.
    *   Parameters $A, B, c$ can be determined from mortality rates at three different ages.
    *   Gompertz' law is a special case of Makeham's law where $A=0$.
